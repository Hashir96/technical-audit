# Website Technical Audit
A basic tool using Javascript & puppeteer to do a short technical SEO audit of a given page. 

## How does it work?

The program would extract the META title & description, the heading structure and the images on the page along with their alt text. Additionally it will check if the XML sitemap and robots.txt for the domain exists or not.

## Usage

1. Download and Run the .exe file from the release or compile the code yourself.
2. Enter the URL of the website. Make sure to include the HTTPS protocol otherwise it will not be able to navigate to the page.
3. Wait for the results
4. Find the complete technical details of the page in the text file that is generated.
